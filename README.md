To be able to commit your updates, please contact me (fiki574) and I'll add you to Collaborators (do not fork this repo, lets do everything here).

The whole emulator is currently set-up to connect to 127.0.0.1, so all you need to do is download the code and compile it (as well as fix few errors that are related to certain directories that stayed tied to my PC).

You CANNOT enter districts yet.

Here you can find variety of tools, source codes, executables, information, etc. that can and will help you in researching/developing rAPB (if you wonder what rAPB means, it's short form of rebornAPB).

Despite this project being open-source, GNU License v3.0 is present!
